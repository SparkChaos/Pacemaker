## Welcome to Pacemaker Clustering.

This document serves as a guide to applying Pacemaker clustering in a Red Hat 7 or CentOS 7 environment.

At the moment, this document is accurate and there is work being carried out at the moment to make a strap script available.

The strap script will contain customizable options for quick deployment of an HA Pacemaker cluster.

Other components include STONITH (PF, PP, SBD).

For the time being, please refer to the documentation to walkthrough the setup process of Pacemaker.
